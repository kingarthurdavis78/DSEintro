Fun fact: I am getting married in January :)

Favorite Classes in Undergrad:

1. CS 110 - How to Code
    After I took this introductory python course, I helped the professor with further course development and became the Head TA. The professor and I are still good friends :)
2. GERM 250 - Marx, Nietzsche, Freud
    I believe in order to be a sophisticated intellectual you need to study the works of people you think you dissagree with. I found this course challenging and refining.
3. CS 260 - Web programming
    In this class I made a website that hosts 'Jackbox'-like games. It was a fun project-oriented class.
4. MATH 438: Modeling with Dynamics and Control
    Here we covered partial differential equations, calculus of variations, and optimal control. I just think this stuff is so cool.
5. MATH 344: Mathematical Analysis
    This gave me a solid mathematical foundation. My favorite topics were linear algebra, contraction mappings, convex analysis, and fourier analysis.

This video is the result of [this code.](quantum-visual.ipynb)
It demonstrates how quantum states are represented mathematically and how the measurement process works in quantum mechanics.
